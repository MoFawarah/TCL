Splits a string into words based on a certain delimiter like " " or ",". The default is " ".

reverseList -->

reverse -->
Reverses a given string by splitting it into words and then reversing the order of words.

Usage:

Sorting Example:
puts [sort {3 6 8 7 0 1 4 2 9 5}]
Output: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
